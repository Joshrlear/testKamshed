## IMPORTANT
    -   OCR is not currently working for buffer streaming.
        currently requires url.
        We don't want to save image anywhere. If possible
        it would be best to send info as binary stream or 
        string and not save info anywhere.



-   Need to run textDetection async with faceVerification

-   Currently '/upload' http request with info will run faceVerification.
    This is where it will run the textDetection async (Promise.all)

-   Then run next() to trigger callback on express http request.
    At this time we'll respond with faceVerification status: 
    'Verified/Not Verified' as well as user verication status:
    'Pending'. Then, send text from id to be verified via some 
    service using (likely) another http request.

-   Inside the original function we need to verify no image doctoring
